Creating new API endpoint:
create an API endpoint in keycloak.py. The backend function that it calls should be created in api_keycloak_utils.py. Any further helper function(s) called by this backend function should be created in misc_keycloak_utils.py. First check existing functions; new functions should be created only if the existing functions don't serve your purpose. Any new API URL that is not already available in keycloak_vars.py should be appended to this file and imported / used in the required module. Follow the pattern already adopted in the existing code with respect to creating, saving and importing variables and functions. Don't delete any code.

Modifying:
Please note that API endpoints are defined in keycloak.py. The backend function that each API endpoint calls is defined in api_keycloak_utils.py. Any further helper function(s) called by this backend function exists in misc_keycloak_utils.py. Follow the pattern already adopted in the existing code with respect to creating, saving and importing variables and functions. First check existing functions; new functions should be created only if the existing functions don't serve your purpose. Any new API URL that is not already available in keycloak_vars.py should be appended to this file and imported / used in the required module. Don't delete any code.
